# Raspberry_HandTracker

This is a Raspberry Pi robotic project.

The ultimate target is to have a raspberry pi camera mounted on a pan-til mechanism with 2 servos.

Appart from that, a Google Coral with a pretrained deep learning model will recognize a hand and also the center of its bounding box. The rasperry pi will control the pan-tilt mechanism so that the camera follows the hand.
